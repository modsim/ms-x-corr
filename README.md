(MS/)MS-X-Corr
==============
MS and MS/MS are software tools for the correction of natural abundance introduced in isotope labeling experiments. They can be used to correct IDMS based metabolome data as well. 


Purpose
-------

The primary purpose is to provide easy-to-use Matlab tools for scientists that work with data from isotope labeling experiments that are subjected to metabolomics and 13C fluxomics applications.


For users
---------

A tutorial has still to be written. If you are using the MS or MS/MS tool, please cite the original publications. The software packages are distributed under the GPLv3 license.
